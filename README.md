Take-home challenge for the modeling engineer role

## Run app
To run the app, install all modules per requirements.txt.
Then on console, run "application.py"

## To re-run the solver/optimizer:
Manually change the parameter "user_select" to "Yes". In future versions, I may make this feature user interactive on the app page in future releases.
